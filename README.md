- 👋 Hi, I’m @Danielit2012
- 👀 I’m interested in getting the best out of web. Lately I've planned to transfer and setup a wordpress website hosted by Bluehost, on my own built private server. Managed to put together a 90 % genuine Intel server with 2 x 4214R 2.40 GHz 12/24 Cores/Threads 16.5M Cache Cpu's and 120 Ram. Working on networking and OS side now, but need to get familiar with Linux and Apache.
- Probaly there are others like me out there so why not...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit of everithing, but mostly interested in C , Visual Fox pro , Cpannel , Plesk , Html , JS , SSH , Python , Css , Linux, 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Os and server implementation , software setup and security, website building and hosting services so there will be lot of setup work and coding to do. I'll post my issues and chalanges here. Using linux wil need lots of repositories to work with.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
